## Reporting a Vulnerability

At WUCSS, we take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your help in responsibly disclosing any potential issues. To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Step 1**: Reach out to us by sending an email to [Simon Gross](mailto:simon.gross.sg1@roche.com). Please include the word "WUCSS REPO SECURITY VULNERABILITY" in the subject line.

2. **Step 2**: Provide detailed information about the vulnerability, including:

   - A clear description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - Any additional information or tools required for reproduction.
   - Your name and contact information.

3. **Step 3**: Once the vulnerability is confirmed and mitigated, we will release the necessary fixes and updates.

## Bug Bounty Program

If you find critical vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Remote Code Execution or Exposed Credentials and can provide a proof of concept, the Roche Vulnerability Management Team may also invite you to Roche's private HackerOne bug bounty programme and reward you for your findings.

## Responsible Disclosure

- We kindly request that you do not exploit any potential vulnerabilities you discover.
- We commit to keeping you informed about the progress of resolving any reported vulnerabilities and to provide credit (if desired) for your responsible disclosure.

## Scope

This security policy applies to all versions of our software and services.
